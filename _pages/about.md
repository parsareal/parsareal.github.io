I am Parsa Kavehzadeh, an NLP researcher specializing in the development and optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs). Currently, I work at Huawei Technologies Canada, where I introduced Sorted LLaMA, a method for integrating nested submodels into a single LLM, and developed a confidence-based early exiting mechanism to accelerate inference.

I earned my MSc in Computer Science at York University under the supervision of [Professor Enamul Hoque](https://www.yorku.ca/enamulh/), focusing on natural language interactions with visualizations, including chart comprehension and reasoning. My research also encompassed a novel chart pretraining method and a survey on chart question answering. Previously, I completed my BSc in Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology, exploring deep learning for anomaly detection and text chunking.

My interests include efficient LLM training, inference acceleration, and multi-modal systems integrating NLP and computer vision. I’ve published in top-tier conferences like EACL, EMNLP, and EuroVis and received recognition such as MVP at Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab.
