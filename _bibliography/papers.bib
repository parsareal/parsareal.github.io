    abstract = "Charts are widely used for data analysis, providing visual representations and insights into complex data. To facilitate chart-based data analysis using natural language, several downstream tasks have been introduced recently such as chart question answering and chart summarization. However, existing methods for these tasks often rely on pretraining on language or vision-language tasks, neglecting the explicit modeling of chart structures (e.g., how chart elements are related to each other). To address this, we first build a large corpus of charts covering diverse topics and visual styles. We then present UniChart, a pretrained model for chart comprehension and reasoning. UniChart encodes the relevant text, data, and visual elements of charts and then uses a chart-grounded text decoder for text generation. We propose several chart-specific pretraining tasks that include: (i) low-level tasks to extract the visual elements (e.g., bars, lines) and data from charts, and (ii) high-level tasks to acquire chart understanding and reasoning skills. Our experiments demonstrate that pretraining UniChart on a large corpus with chart-specific objectives, followed by fine-tuning, yields state-of-the-art performance on four downstream tasks. Moreover, our model exhibits superior generalizability to unseen chart corpus, surpassing previous approaches that lack chart-specific objectives and utilize limited chart resources.",

      abstract={Deployment of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) is costly, and as these models increase in size, the associated costs will become even more considerable. Consequently, different methods have been proposed to accelerate the token generation process and reduce costs. Speculative decoding (SD) is among the most promising approaches to speed up the LLM decoding process by verifying multiple tokens in parallel and using an auxiliary smaller draft model to generate the possible tokens. In SD, usually, one draft model is used to serve a specific target model; however, in practice, LLMs are diverse, and we might need to deal with many target models or more than one target model simultaneously. In this scenario, it is not clear which draft model should be used for which target model, and searching among different draft models or training customized draft models can further increase deployment costs. In this paper, we first introduce a novel multi-target scenario for the deployment of draft models for faster inference. Then, we present a novel, more efficient sorted speculative decoding mechanism that outperforms regular baselines in multi-target settings. We evaluated our method on Spec-Bench in different settings, including base models such as Vicuna 7B, 13B, and LLama Chat 70B. Our results suggest that our draft models perform better than baselines for multiple target models at the same time.}

    abstract = "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by excelling at understanding and generating human-like text. However, their widespread deployment can be prohibitively expensive. SortedNet is a recent training technique for enabling dynamic inference by leveraging the modularity in networks and sorting sub-models based on computation/accuracy in a nested manner. We extend SortedNet to generative NLP tasks, making large language models dynamic without any Pre-Training and by only replacing Standard Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Sorted Fine-Tuning (SoFT). Our approach boosts model efficiency, eliminating the need for multiple models for various scenarios during inference. We show that this approach can unlock the potential of intermediate layers of transformers in generating the target output. Our sub-models remain integral components of the original model, minimizing storage requirements and transition costs between different computational/latency budgets. The efficacy of our proposed method was demonstrated by applying it to tune LLaMA 2 13B on the Stanford Alpaca dataset for instruction following and TriviaQA for closed-book question answering. Our results show the superior performance of sub-models in comparison to Standard Fine-Tuning and SFT+ICT (Early-Exit), all achieved with very efficient tuning and without additional memory usage during inference.",

      abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) must cater to a variety of users with different performance needs and budgets, leading to the costly practice of training, storing, and maintaining numerous user/task specific models. There are solutions in the literature to deal with single dynamic or many-in-one models instead of many individual networks; however, they suffer from significant drop of performance, lack of generalization across different model architectures or different dimensions (e.g. depth, width, attention blocks), heavy model search requirements during training, and training a limited number of sub-models. To address these limitations, we propose SortedNet, a generalized and scalable training solution to harness the inherent modularity of DNNs. Thanks to a generalized nested architecture (which we refer as sorted architecture in this paper) with shared parameters and its novel update scheme combining random sub-model sampling and a new gradient accumulation mechanism, SortedNet enables the training of sub-models simultaneously along with the training of the main model (without any significant extra training or inference overhead), simplifies dynamic model selection, customizes deployment during inference, and reduces the model storage requirement significantly. The versatility and scalability of SortedNet are validated through various architectures and tasks including LLaMA, BERT, RoBERTa (NLP tasks), ResNet and MobileNet (image classification) demonstrating its superiority over existing dynamic training methods. For example, we introduce a novel adaptive self-speculative approach based on sorted-training to accelerate large language models decoding. Moreover, SortedNet is able to train up to 160 sub-models at once, achieving at least 96% of the original model’s performance.}

      abstract={Information visualizations such as bar charts and line charts are very common for analyzing data and discovering critical insights. Often people analyze charts to answer questions that they have in mind. Answering such questions can be challenging as they often require a significant amount of perceptual and cognitive effort. Chart Question Answering (CQA) systems typically take a chart and a natural language question as input and automatically generate the answer to facilitate visual data analysis. Over the last few years, there has been a growing body of literature on the task of CQA. In this survey, we systematically review the current state-of-the-art research focusing on the problem of chart question answering. We provide a taxonomy by identifying several important dimensions of the problem domain including possible inputs and outputs of the task and discuss the advantages and limitations of proposed solutions. We then summarize various evaluation techniques used in the surveyed papers. Finally, we outline the open challenges and future research opportunities related to chart question answering.}
